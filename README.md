# Modern Blackjack Game Using VB.NET

Hi, this is the most interesting and fun blackjack project I've ever made. I made it using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and using Visual Basic programming language.

I am very proud of my blackjack game project, I made it with a very modern and attractive design in accordance with today's developments. This project is open to anyone who wants to develop and improve it for the better.

# Menu
In this blackjack game project I made several menus into it, namely the sign-in, home, and game menus.Here's a view of the project I made:
<h2>Sign in</h2>

I made Sign In menu to determine the avatar and username of the player to make it look more interactive and interesting when starting the game and know how to play it easily. On the sign-in menu, there are 6 avatars that one must choose and a username that must be filled in for user biodata.

<h2>Home Page</h2>

I created the home page menu with the aim of providing basic knowledge of playing blackjack and giving the impression of an attractive visual design so that players are interested in playing the game and this menu has a "Play" button which will immediately start the game.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

In this gameplay view I am still making 1 vs 1, namely the player against the computer, so I give this project to be developed for those who want to develop it even better. I made the game display according to the rules of the blackjack game with an attractive visual design.
